# Unscramble Computer Science Problems Analysis

## Task0
This excersie runs in O(1) notation, due the algorithm perfoms 2 steps that access to the first 
and last records 

## Task1
This excersie runs in O(1) notation, due we have acces all the elements of each list. Additionaly 
the worst case maybe runs in O(n) due the conditional operations on each list

## Task2
This excersie runs in O(n) notation, due we have acces all the elements of each list. Additionaly 
the space complexity given by the sort_dictionary function that runs O(1) and the number of conditional 
operations it endend into 0(n)

## Task3
This excersie runs in O(n log n), due in needs to do a full scan of each item of the call list doing a
comparison-based nested routines looking for the prefix and includes a sorting operation.

## Task4
This excersie runs in O(n log n), due to the fact that we have to use sorting operation, but additionaly it 
use an O(n) of adding elements to diferent lists.
